### My Approach

I operate as an independent technical partner rather than a hired coder. I take full responsibility for the project lifecycle:

1. **Business Alignment:** Before writing any code, I analyze your business goals, target audience, and marketing strategy to ensure the technical solution drives actual value.
2. **System Architecture:** I design databases, backend logic, and user interfaces that are scalable and maintainable.
3. **Custom Development:** I build the core custom logic and integrations from scratch, ensuring a fast time-to-market without sacrificing quality or relying on rigid templates.
4. **Turnkey Delivery:** You receive a fully functional, tested, and optimized product ready for your users.
